### Digital Image & Video Processing
# Image Processing with OpenCV library
- This project of *Jupyter Notebook* by *Python* learn show how to create a program of **Digital Image analyzing and Video Processing**

#### WorkSpace
- To perform basic image processing according to user needs from OpenCV library.
- Installing the **Edge detetion algorithm** with the algorithms learned in class and compare with the function supported by the library.

#### Algorithms included:
- Transform color
- Transform geometry
- Smooth the image (image blurring, image smoothing)
- Edge detection algorithm
