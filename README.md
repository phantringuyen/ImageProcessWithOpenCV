### Digital Image & Video Processing
# Image Processing with OpenCV library
- This project of [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) by [Python](https://www.python.org/) learn show how to create a program of **Digital Image analyzing and Video Processing**

### 1. WorkSpace
- To perform basic image processing according to user needs from [OpenCV library](https://opencv.org/).
- Installing the **Edge detection algorithm** with the algorithms learned in class and comparing it with the library-supported function.

### 2. Algorithms included:
- Transform colour
- Transform geometry
- Smooth the image (image blurring, image smoothing)
- Edge detection algorithm

### Details of Project
- For more details, please review the **Report.pdf** file above. Thank you!
